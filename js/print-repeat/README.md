# print-repeat (2/5)
### Goal
Once fixed, `printRepeat.js` should read a plain text file and print each word the indicated number of times. Each line in an input file will have a positive number followed by a space indicating the number of times to print the remaining contents of the line. After the space, the string of indeterminate length will follow. Be sure not to print the integer number of times to the console- just print the string that follows. Look at the included examples to see what the input (`test<N>.txt`) and goal output (`goal<N>.txt`) look like.
### Running
Use the following command to run `<TEST_NAME>.txt`:\
`node printRepeat.js <TEST_NAME>.txt`
