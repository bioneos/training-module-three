# array-intersection (3/5)
### Goal
Once fixed, `arrayIntersection.js` should read the first two lines from a plain text file. Each line will contain a space-separated list of words. The program should log the number of elements in the intersection of the two lists to the console i.e. the number of words that appear in both lists. It should be case insensitive (e.g. "The" and "the" are the same). Look at the included examples to see what the input (`test<N>.txt`) and goal output (`goal<N>.txt`) look like.
### Running
Use the following command to run `<TEST_NAME>.txt`:\
`node arrayIntersection.js <TEST_NAME>.txt`
