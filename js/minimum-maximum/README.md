# array-reversal (2/5)
### Goal
Once fixed, `minimumMaximum.js` should read a series of number from a plain text file and print the minimum and maximum numbers in that list to the console. Each input file will contain a space-separated list of numbers on the first line. The program will print the minimum and maximum numbers to the console. Look at the included examples to see what the input (`test<N>.txt`) and goal output (`goal<N>.txt`) look like.
### Running
Use the following command to run `<TEST_NAME>.txt`:\
`node arrayReversal.js <TEST_NAME>.txt`
