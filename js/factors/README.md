# factors (3/5)
### Goal
Once fixed, `factors.js` should accept a single command line parameter of a positive integer. The
program will then determine all factors of this integer and output them with console log messages.
Look at the included examples to see what the goal output (`goal<N>.txt`) should look like, and at
the top of each of these goals will be a comment showing how the script was executed.
### Running
Make sure that you have a modern version of NodeJS installed on your machine and executable for your
user account and then use the following command to run the script:
```node factors.js <NUMBER>```
