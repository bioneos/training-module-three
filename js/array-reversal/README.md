# array-reversal (1/5)
### Goal
Once fixed, `arrayReversal.js` should read a plain text file and print it to the console with the words in reverse order. Each input file will contain a list of words on one line. The program will print the same space-seperated list of words back to the console but backwards. Look at the included examples to see what the input (`test<N>.txt`) and goal output (`goal<N>.txt`) look like.
### Running
Use the following command to run `<TEST_NAME>.txt`:\
`node arrayReversal.js <TEST_NAME>.txt`
