# string-memory (4/5)
### Goal
Once fixed, `StringMemory.java` should read a text file and compare the lists of words. Each input file will have two lines of space-separated strings. Much like the card game [Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)), each word in one list must correspond to the same word in the other list (note that this version should be case insensitive). If all the words have matches, the program should print as such to the console. Otherwise, it should indicate that no such group of matches exists. Look at the included examples to see what the input (`test<N>.txt`) and goal output (`goal<N>.txt`) look like.
### Compiling and Running
Use the following command to build the program:\
`javac StringMemory.java`\
Then use this command to run the code on `<TEST_NAME>.txt`:\
`java StringMemory <TEST_NAME>.txt`\
The results will appear in the console.
