# training-module-three
Repository to hold example sets of source code for debugging purposes. These files will serve as exercises for on-boarding employees through Bio::Neos's third training module.

Each problem contains a `README.md` file. It will explain the goal of the code and assign a difficulty rating out of five (1 = easiest, 5 = hardest). In addition, each problem will contain test cases in the `README.md` file or in seperate text files.
